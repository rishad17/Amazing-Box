# 🌟 Amazing Box

_A visually engaging interactive animation using PyOpenGL in Python._

---

## 🎨 Description

**Amazing Box** is a simple but visually striking OpenGL-based program where colorful points bounce around within a window. You can interact with them by spawning new points, changing their behavior, and controlling their motion using the keyboard and mouse.

This project is ideal for those learning about graphics programming and real-time animation using OpenGL in Python.
